#Thesis: App-Prototyping-and-Customer-Data-Analysis-For-Fashion-Production-Decisions

# Introduction:

Why fashion? : As an informatics student, I have always been fascinated by the power
of data analysis and technology to transform industries and create new opportunities. I
believe that the fashion industry is ripe for such transformation, and that there are
many exciting possibilities for using technology to drive innovation and growth.

# Data Analysis Using Jupyter:

I have included the data analysis section, which I created using Jupyter Notebook and 
Python coding, as outlined in the thesis documentation. I've produced two separate 
files, each with its own objective. Additionally, I've included the CSV file 
that was utilized in the analysis.

Please check the files attached above:comprehensive_Exploratory_data analysis.ipynb /systematically_organized_and_processed_data_analysis.ipynb /shopping_trends.CSV

# Application Figma Design And Prototype:
I have also included the application figma design link for a better overview.
